### Daily Scrum Log
_Before starting to work, write a daily scrum. This will help you to switch tasks to and focus on this scrum (Your personal scrum is probably not the only thing you do in life) and give you a log to evaluate your productivity during retrospectives. Never skip this!_

__Sprint:__ 1
__Date:__ 3/12/18
 1. __What did I do yesterday to help achieve the Sprint Goal?__
 - Populate the backlog
 2. __What Will I do today to help achieve the Sprint Goal?__
 - Shop for A/V equipment
 - Ask experts what they recommend
 - Send shopping list to Amanda to get her input
 3. __Do I see any blockers that could prevent me from achieving the Sprint Goal?__
 - Two of the three goals will need another human's input.
 - The A/V Equipment needs to be vetted by someone who know's what they're doing. (I'm betting the Improv Theatre and Podcast people will know, and Amanda is a Pro at this).
 - OpenWaza Meetup needs approval from Ray and then access to our company's meetup pages to make it a reality.
 - To help remove these blockers, I'm starting with theses two, and making it a priority to hit the ball to the other side of the court as soon as possible. I'll follow up if there isn't an immediate response.
