### Daily Scrum Log
_Before starting to work, write a daily scrum. This will help you to switch tasks to and focus on this scrum (Your personal scrum is probably not the only thing you do in life) and give you a log to evaluate your productivity during retrospectives. Never skip this!_

 3. __Do I see any blockers that could prevent me from achieving the Sprint Goal?__
 - Kind of don't want to go. Feeling lazy or tired. If I can't walk over to the dojo by 15 minutes before class I'm not going. I hate being embarrassed by being late.

 3. __Do I see any blockers that could prevent me from achieving the Sprint Goal?__
 - Flustered from the day's work. Also my stomach is growly. I'll need to focus. Even so, I'll likely only get the slides done. This is a little much considering how I've done so far.

__Date:__ 3/13/18
 1. __What did I do yesterday to help achieve the Sprint Goal?__
 - Shop for A/V equipment
 - Get Feedback for A/V equipment from experts and Amanda
 - Communicate with Ray about my vision and 8th Light's benefit
 - Integrate that vision into Ray's vision for the 8th Light office
 - Get the ball rolling about getting A/V equipment from Ray, online, and perhaps from 8th Light
 - Get the ball rolling about setting up OpenWaza at 8th Light
 - Order a 3D printer kit
 2. __What Will I do today to help achieve the Sprint Goal?__
 - Assemble a final wish-list of A/V equipment to buy at the drop of a hat
 3. __Do I see any blockers that could prevent me from achieving the Sprint Goal?__
 - The final acquisition of A/V equipment will depend on other humans. I'll time box that til mid-April. If no progress has been made, I'll go ahead and make a purchase at that time.
 - OpenWaza Meetup has initial approval from Ray! I'll need to wait for him to bring the other 8th Light organizers onboard before I can pull the trigger. I'll give him a friendly reminder on Friday if he hasn't acted by then.
 - The ball is being hit across the net as soon as possible. To not waste the wait-time, I'll start setting up everything else so that as soon as I know yes-or-know I'm ready to go.

__Date:__ 3/12/18
 1. __What did I do yesterday to help achieve the Sprint Goal?__
 - Populate the backlog
 2. __What Will I do today to help achieve the Sprint Goal?__
 - Shop for A/V equipment
 - Ask experts what they recommend
 - Send shopping list to Amanda to get her input
 3. __Do I see any blockers that could prevent me from achieving the Sprint Goal?__
 - Two of the three goals will need another human's input.
 - The A/V Equipment needs to be vetted by someone who know's what they're doing. (I'm betting the Improv Theatre and Podcast people will know, and Amanda is a Pro at this).
 - OpenWaza Meetup needs approval from Ray and then access to our company's meetup pages to make it a reality.
 - To help remove these blockers, I'm starting with theses two, and making it a priority to hit the ball to the other side of the court as soon as possible. I'll follow up if there isn't an immediate response.
