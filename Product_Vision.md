### Product Vision:

_This is a place to write down your ultimate goal. Do not get technically specific here. This is a place to define your values and allow those values to drive the direction of your learning. With everything you create in your roadmap, backlog and stories, and by the standard you evaluate your work in reviews and retrospectives, each item should fit within the definition described by this vision.

You are the product._

### Product RoadMap:

_This is where you will break down your vision into large-scale objectives. Three to five of these seem like a good amount, but do what works for you. You might only need a single item._
