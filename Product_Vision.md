### Product Vision:

A skilled craftsperson ready to collaborate, contribute and add value to a team working in an agile development environment.

I am the product. 

### Product RoadMap:

  1. __A Firm Foundation__ I need to have a solid grasp of the fundamentals of software. This includes learning what doesn't change in computing, and how I relate to it as a specific instance of a human. Along with this come practical skills, common languages, OOP, Functional Programming, Web technologies and the infrastructure that supports my development and production environments.

  2. __Continuing Exploration__ I need to be curious about random new stuff on the horizon. Fundamentals are definitely important, but its fun to explore new ways of doing things and the expanding possibilities they create. Tech and tools not currently in use, but potentially interesting are things to focus on. Also seeking out diverse interests outside of tech is important to help shake-up my thinking and foster new approaches.

  3. __Diving Deep__ As I ground myself in the fundamentals and explore the possibilities, I will be on the lookout for something that is exceptionally interesting to dive deep in and contribute back to the software community with expertship. But this can't be accomplished without the above two.
