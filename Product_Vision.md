### Product Vision:

A well-known and regarded consulting software engineer in robotics and embedded systems able to generate client interest for my company, able to cultivate a richly diverse community, and able to bring value to all living things.

### Product RoadMap:

__Hard Skills__ In order to achieve my vision I need to teach myself the hard skills necessary to be an excellent embedded software engineer. By integrating my diverse background with these hard skills, I can not only bring value to my client, but to her team, and to her users. By leading with my values, I can help create solutions that will benefit all of humanity, and all life. At the very least, I must do no harm.

__Well-Known__ In order to achieve my vision I need to be well-known from meetup and conference talks, from podcast interviews, and from blog posts. These activities will generate interest among the clients I most want to work with.

__Teacher__ In order to achieve my vision I will need to be a Teacher, a Coach and a Mentor to my clients and to my community, encouraging excellence and establishing a culture of continual improvement through exploration. This will allow me to cultivate the kind of community I would want to work within.
