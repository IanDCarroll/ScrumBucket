  - seeing the other 8th Light offices is just fun.
  - The interview will increase how well I'm known in the developer community.
  - Waza Hack nights will add a no cost fame and leadership value addition to my embedded systems learning.
  - Being a PDB gains me experience as a leader and a consultant.
  - Reading consulting secrets gives me further insight into being a coach and an agent for change. It also enables me to come up with a few good internal and external talks, including a good first video for the youtube channel.
  - getting books from Claudia will give me some more tools in how to transform the organizations I work with.

  - Improv - 3
  - Got the Sense Hat up and Running on Raspberry Pi - 2
  - Conducted the Raspberry Pi Meetup - 5

 - __Why is it valuable?__
  - Improv makes me a leader in the software world on public speaking
  - Now that I have the sense hat up and running, I can start to find ways to integrate it with my tic tac toe app
  - Conducting the meetup helped to frame me as a leader - and it helped other people who were attending
  - Knowing how the shell interacts with the kernel is extremely powerful, especially when interacting with embedded systems which may not have a shell or a kernel
  - The first draft on retrospectives was really great for breaking the ice on the subject with my team and for making a clear case on why they're valuable

__Sprint:__ 1
 - __What did you complete this sprint?__
  - Ordered a new open source 3D printer kit
  - Got green lit for OpenWaza
  - Put together equipment wishlist for A/V equipment.
 - __Why is it valuable?__
  - The 3D printer kit will not only yield a new 3D printer that is better than the current one. Assembling the parts will familiarize me with the boudary between hardware and software. The Fact that it's open source means that I will be able to maintain and improve the 3D printer the same way I would for code. This is an excellent introduction the the embedded space, and the sooner I bring it in, the sooner it will start augmenting the value of my later projects.
  - There is no extra cost for turning waza into a meetup and there is definitely extra benefit in marketing 8th Light's values, engaging the DTLA community, and holding me accountable to waza. The sooner this is implemented, the better.
  - The sooner I get the A/V equipment, the sooner we can start practicing recording.
