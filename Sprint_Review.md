__Sprint:__ 1
 - __What did you complete this sprint?__
  - Ordered a new open source 3D printer kit
  - Got green lit for OpenWaza
  - Put together equipment wishlist for A/V equipment.
 - __Why is it valuable?__
  - The 3D printer kit will not only yield a new 3D printer that is better than the current one. Assembling the parts will familiarize me with the boudary between hardware and software. The Fact that it's open source means that I will be able to maintain and improve the 3D printer the same way I would for code. This is an excellent introduction the the embedded space, and the sooner I bring it in, the sooner it will start augmenting the value of my later projects.
  - There is no extra cost for turning waza into a meetup and there is definitely extra benefit in marketing 8th Light's values, engaging the DTLA community, and holding me accountable to waza. The sooner this is implemented, the better.
  - The sooner I get the A/V equipment, the sooner we can start practicing recording.
