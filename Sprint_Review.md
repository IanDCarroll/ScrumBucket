__Sprint:__ 2
 - __What did you complete this sprint?__
  - Publish 8th Light's Waza Hack Nights
  - Gather A/V resources
  - Purchase a Camera to complete the A/V equipment we need
  - Gather more mentors on digital film craft
  - Do a talk on Machine Learning
  - Go to Aikido
  - Go to Improv
  - Publish 8th Light's Raspberry Pi Meetup
 - __Why is it valuable?__
  - Waza hack nights will hold me accountable to my continued learning. It also sets 8th Light as a leader in the community. It adds value to every waza that happens afterward.
  - A/V equipment will allow us to publish our talks online and become a leader in the advocacy high quality code.
  - The machine learning talk sets me in the position of being the machine learning expert among my peers.
  - Aikido has analogies to how to harmonize the opposing energy of clients.
  - Improv has use as a tool to allow me to listen more carefully to my clients.
  - The Raspberry Pi Meetup is good for me getting into embedded systems, and also is something aligned with my vision.

__Sprint:__ 1
 - __What did you complete this sprint?__
  - Ordered a new open source 3D printer kit
  - Got green lit for OpenWaza
  - Put together equipment wishlist for A/V equipment.
 - __Why is it valuable?__
  - The 3D printer kit will not only yield a new 3D printer that is better than the current one. Assembling the parts will familiarize me with the boudary between hardware and software. The Fact that it's open source means that I will be able to maintain and improve the 3D printer the same way I would for code. This is an excellent introduction the the embedded space, and the sooner I bring it in, the sooner it will start augmenting the value of my later projects.
  - There is no extra cost for turning waza into a meetup and there is definitely extra benefit in marketing 8th Light's values, engaging the DTLA community, and holding me accountable to waza. The sooner this is implemented, the better.
  - The sooner I get the A/V equipment, the sooner we can start practicing recording.
