### Sprint Goal

 _Take as many of the most valuable item(s) from the_ `Product_Backlog` _that you could realistically do in a sprint and commit to doing them in this list. Rephrase them into the sentence structure below for added personal clarity._

__About points:__
Point the items your committing to as follows:

 - __1 - Trivial:__ You can get 3 or more of these done in a single session.
 - __2 - Easy:__ You can get 2 of these done in a single session.
 - __3 - Medium:__ It will take you 1 to 1 & 1/2 sessions to do this.
 - __5 - Hard:__ It will take you 2 to 3 sessions to do this.
 - __8 - Tough:__ It will take you at least 4 sessions of the sprint to do this.
 - __13 - Monstrous:__ It will take you at least the whole sprint to do this and it might not get done even then. Consider breaking 13s into smaller more doable tasks.

Points don't reflect time scales. I know I used time scales here, but you're free to change them to whatever makes sense for you. You cannot compare your points to other people's points in an effort to compare your productivity. It is entirely subjective, but still useful for comparing your past results to your present productivity and making decisions about what to change to optimize it. Ultimately the points are a metric, and should be viewed as only a guide to reality. _They don't represent your actual productivity!!_ They just help as a soft data-point in your analysis. Do not make the fakey-made-up numbers your god and sacrifice real productivity to them! Otherwise, have fun! ::smile::
