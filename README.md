# ScrumBucket

This is a process log to use on GitHub for self-directed learners.

### It's purposes include:

1. __Focus:__ Allowing you to focus on studying what's most valuable right now.
2. __Commitment:__ Allowing you to form habits and make tangible, valuable progress.
3. __Openness:__ Allowing your future self to examine what's been happening and make adjustments.
4. __Respect:__ Allowing you to work within the bounds of what's humanly possible.
5. __Courage:__ Allowing you to take inexpensive risks, get messy, make mistakes and learn.

This makes public what would be post-it notes on a wall. It also means that others can see you slacking! Or making absurd goals (like building a fully decked out android app in a month when you don't know OO or Java yet). Its ok, learning is messy. And beautiful.

### How it works:

It's just a series of markdown files.

1. Make a list in `Product_Backlog` of any software concept, tool, framework, language, or what-have-you that you'd like to know, or reasonably claim to know.

2. Set a time box for you iterations (aka: "Sprints"). 1 Week seems to work well for a single person, but pick what you like. And don't change it lightly. The rhythm is important to make this work. Record this in your `Working_Agreement`

3. Decide what done looks like. Only working code? Tests pass? Docs up-to-date? Keep it simple at first, you can adjust as time goes on. Record this in your `Definition_of_Done`

4. Pick the most important handfull of items in the `Product_Backlog` to do, and make those your new `Sprint_Goal`. Go ahead and give them some arbitrary points based on how much time you think they'll need to get done.

5. At the start of the day record a `Daily_Scrum`.

6. At the end of the sprint, evaluate how much you got done. Add what you got done to your `Sprint_Review` and compare that to what you expected to get done.

7. Don't kick yourself! This is valuable feedback that let's you know what you can reasonably do. Decide whether to set more realistic expectations, or change your process to get more done. (Most likely you'll do both, contrary to the scientific method. It's fine.) Record these decisions in `Sprint_Retrospective`. Make changes to the `Working_Agreement` and `Definition_of_Done` if necessary.

8. Start the next iteration at step 4. Repeat until awesome.
