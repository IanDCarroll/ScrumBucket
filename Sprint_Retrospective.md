__Sprint:__ 1
 - __Overall impressions of the sprint:__ A pretty good start!
 - __What went well?__
   - Got quite a lot done and quickly.
   - Getting back to the personal scrum is very rewarding. It's keeping my spirits up.
   - Was able to bring in something from each element of the road map.
 - __What didn't go well?__
   - I was tired and I missed my Aikido practice
  - __Why?__
    - because I was so busy I didn't have much time for sleep or for proper planning.
  - __Why?__
    - because I'm taking on too much.
  - __Why?__
    - Because I am using recreational time to do my personal scrum.
  - __Why?__
    - Because I used to do this at Barnes and Noble and it worked fine.
  - __Why?__
    - Because I didn't have Aikido and Improv, nor did I have as long a commute.
 - __What actions will you take next sprint to make it better?__
  - Protect your sleep time.
  - Bring Aikido and Improv into the scrum. These two activities add value to my software development.
  - Keep each week's work small.
  - Do not disengage, make smaller circles.
