__Sprint:__ 5
 - __Overall impressions of the sprint:__ It went better than expected. I didn't really think I could do all that considering what happened last week.
 - __What went well?__ The change-up of Aikido and Improv works pretty well. It gives me more energy. Also the abandoned office on Saturday is great for recording. Additionally the meetups are allowing me to get things done from my personal scrum while I run the meetups.
 - __What didn't go well?__ I didn't get to do review/retro until Monday.
  - __Why?__ Because I was tired on Friday, I couldn't record during waza time then, so I went home.
 - __What actions will you take next sprint to make it better?__
  - Move review/retro to Sunday this week. That way I log the time correctly.

__Sprint:__ 4
 - __Overall impressions of the sprint:__ I got a lot done, none of which was a thing I planned for.
 - __What went well?__ Considering how much happened, a lot of really important developments towards my overall goals.
 - __What didn't go well?__ None of my stated goals got done.
  - __Why?__ They were too big.
  - __Why?__ I let someone else pick them.
  - __Why?__ Because I didn't maintain my boundaries.
  - __Why?__ Because I wanted to be liked.
  - __Why?__ Because I secretly fear that I'm not good enough.
 - __What actions will you take next sprint to make it better?__ Take some time to tell validate yourself. Take a break from your diet. Treat yourself well this weekend. Everyone else thinks you're fantastic. But it doesn't matter one bit to you if you don't think that about yourself. Treat yourself like a star performer. Then manage your boundaries. You are the PO, not your mentor, not your customers, not your clients, not your company.

__Sprint:__ 3
 - __Overall impressions of the sprint:__ I did well, but I've still got a sleep issue
 - __What went well?__ In addition to doing the meetup, I also snuck an extra story in about the Raspberry Pi SenseHat. Expanded the amount of sleep I'm getting 6:35
 - __What didn't go well?__ The lack of sleep on Wednesday night (5:33) forced me to cancel Aikido practice. I know why. It's still not enough sleep, especially since I got home late after the meetup.
 - __What actions will you take next sprint to make it better?__
  - Expand sleep to at least 7 hours on Wednesday night, the night before Aikido.
  - Work a 10 hour day before any Wednesday meetup. Sleep in an extra two hours Thursday morning.

__Sprint:__ 2
 - __Overall impressions of the sprint:__ I did quite a lot this sprint. Everything was accomplished and more. It's been very positive.
 - __What went well?__ Even though I did not expect to have time for everything, there was time to get it all in, thanks to taking advantage of what otherwise would have been wasted time.
 - __What didn't go well?__ Sleep is apparently a need. Not to mention cognitive and emotional strain from the day's work. That adds to the sense of exhaustion. But I didn't miss Aikido this time. So Obviously I'm getting things working better.
  - __Why?__
   - Last week I averaged 5:36 per night of sleep. (fitbit) This week was 6:03.
  - __Why?__
   - I paid attention to the amount of sleep I'm getting.
  - __Why?__
   - Because I listened to last week's retrospective.
  - __Why?__
   - Because I have made a habit of having a retrospective after every sprint.
  - __Why?__
   - Beacuse this is how I improve my process.
 - __What actions will you take next sprint to make it better?__
  - Try to expand sleep to average 6:30 per night. That should make me cheerier.

  - __Why?__
    - because I'm taking on too much.

    - Because I am using recreational time to do my personal scrum.
