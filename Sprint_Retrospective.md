__Sprint:__ 2
 - __Overall impressions of the sprint:__ I did quite a lot this sprint. Everything was accomplished and more. It's been very positive.
 - __What went well?__ Even though I did not expect to have time for everything, there was time to get it all in, thanks to taking advantage of what otherwise would have been wasted time.
 - __What didn't go well?__ Sleep is apparently a need. Not to mention cognitive and emotional strain from the day's work. That adds to the sense of exhaustion. But I didn't miss Aikido this time. So Obviously I'm getting things working better.
  - __Why?__
   - Last week I averaged 5:36 per night of sleep. (fitbit) This week was 6:03.
  - __Why?__
   - I paid attention to the amount of sleep I'm getting.
  - __Why?__
   - Because I listened to last week's retrospective.
  - __Why?__
   - Because I have made a habit of having a retrospective after every sprint.
  - __Why?__
   - Beacuse this is how I improve my process.
 - __What actions will you take next sprint to make it better?__
  - Try to expand sleep to average 6:30 per night. That should make me cheerier.

__Sprint:__ 1
 - __Overall impressions of the sprint:__ A pretty good start!
 - __What went well?__
   - Got quite a lot done and quickly.
   - Getting back to the personal scrum is very rewarding. It's keeping my spirits up.
   - Was able to bring in something from each element of the road map.
 - __What didn't go well?__
   - I was tired and I missed my Aikido practice
  - __Why?__
    - because I was so busy I didn't have much time for sleep or for proper planning.
  - __Why?__
    - because I'm taking on too much.
  - __Why?__
    - Because I am using recreational time to do my personal scrum.
  - __Why?__
    - Because I used to do this at Barnes and Noble and it worked fine.
  - __Why?__
    - Because I didn't have Aikido and Improv, nor did I have as long a commute.
 - __What actions will you take next sprint to make it better?__
  - Protect your sleep time.
  - Bring Aikido and Improv into the scrum. These two activities add value to my software development.
  - Keep each week's work small.
  - Do not disengage, make smaller circles.
